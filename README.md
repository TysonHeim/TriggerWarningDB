# TriggerWarningDB
We used SQL Server, LINQ, and XAML to create a database application to search for content warnings in a personalized way. Our application is catering to people with mental illnesses (specifically PTSD) or epilepsy. By having a source that automatically can tell you if a piece of media will trigger you and when you can avoid it is a huge anxiety saver. We have a few goal implemented.
	We have the ability to crowd source. This was one of our main goals since no one is going to be able to better identify these content warnings than the people affected by them who want to prevent others from being negatively affected. So both new media and new triggers within a piece of media are able to be added by any logged in user. 
	Users can search for a piece of media and have a spoiler free list given to them of triggers within the media, and compare the mediaâ€™s triggers to the ones they have listed on their profile. If they want more details they can see all the comments and time stamps of the triggers ad well as being shown if it is safe for them to consume the media or not.
	Users also can have media that is safe for them suggested based on a genre and a media type. This means that instead of reading through the content warnings (that are typically made for overprotective parents), they can have a specific browsing list that is catered to their content sensitivities. If they wish to add a trigger to their profile they can easy do so as well.
